This is my first application attempt, since my knowledge has focused on creating dashboards for data analysis.

I have made some modifications in the api code to read the database, and also in the methods to encrypt and generate the token.

This course is really a great opportunity to learn good practices and although it would represent a great effort for me, I have spent a good time demonstrating my enthusiasm.

Thanks to Wizeline community for the time and dedication to teach people like me can get great knowledge and contribute to the world with skills.
